	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--

	-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
	-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
	--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
	--
	-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.


	-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
	--
	-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
	-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
	--
	-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

			"williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim",
			"WhoIsSethDaniel/mason-tool-installer.nvim",

			-- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
			--
			-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
			--
			-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
			-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
			--
			-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
			-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
			-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
			-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
			--
			-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
			--  - Go to definition
			--  - Find references
			--  - Autocompletion
			--  - Symbol Search
			--  - and more!
			--
			-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
			-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
			--
			-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
			-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

			--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
			--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
			--    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
			--    function will be executed to configure the current buffer
